## A ROS2-based Autonomous Mobile Robot Platform

Developed at **Kempten University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule Kempten)**.

The **HSK-Mensabot** project is a ROS2-based mobile robot platform designed for autonomous indoor navigation. It combines modern navigation algorithms, hardware abstraction, integrated safety monitoring, and simulation into a unified software architecture. The system supports both simulation and real-world operation while maintaining a nearly identical software stack for both environments.

The API documentation can be found here: https://fabcode288.github.io/HSK-Mensabot/index.html

# Project Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/Real_Robot_V1.jpg" width="50%">
  <img src="docs/images/gazebo_robot.png" width="46%">
</p>

The software architecture has been developed with a strong focus on modularity, maintainability, and hardware abstraction. The project demonstrates how ROS2 can be used to integrate navigation, localization, hardware control, and functional safety into a single robotic platform.

The repository contains all software required to operate the robot, including simulation, navigation, hardware drivers, utility nodes, launch files, and Arduino firmware.

# System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/dataflow.png">
</p>

The robot software is organized into multiple independent ROS2 packages. Navigation, localization, hardware control, safety, monitoring, and simulation are implemented as separate components communicating via ROS2 topics, services, and actions.

A detailed description of the complete software architecture is available in: **[docs/architecture](docs/architecture)**.

## Real Robot

Start the complete robot on the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
ros2 launch mensabot_bringup real_complete_bringup.launch.py
```

Start the robot without navigation and localization:
```bash
ros2 launch mensabot_bringup real_bringup_robot.launch.py
```

Start the robot without navigation and localization while performing a LiDAR reset:

# Current Issues

- **Migration to TwistStamped:** Nav2 can now directly publish `TwistStamped` messages. The current `cmd_vel_transform_node`, which converts `Twist` to `TwistStamped`, is therefore no longer required. The system should be migrated to use `TwistStamped` directly and the transformation node removed.

- **IMU Coordinate Frames:** The coordinate frames of the raw IMU data and processed IMU data are currently inconsistent. The frame orientations must be aligned to ensure a consistent coordinate system throughout the localization pipeline. This inconsistency causes increasing odometry errors over time, resulting in noticeable jittering of the robot.

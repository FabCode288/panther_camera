"""
Launch file for AMCL-based localization.

This launch file starts the Nav2 localization stack using Adaptive Monte
Carlo Localization (AMCL) and loads the predefined environment map together
with the project-specific localization parameters.

After the localization components have been initialized, a global
localization request is executed to distribute the initial particle set
across the entire map.

Launch Arguments:
    params_file:
        AMCL parameter file.

    map:
        Occupancy grid map used for localization.

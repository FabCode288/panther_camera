# Hardware

The **HSK-Mensabot** is built on a modular hardware platform consisting of a Raspberry Pi 5, an Arduino-based motor controller, two SICK NanoScan3 safety laser scanners, an IMU, certified safety hardware and two integrated servo motors. The hardware architecture is designed to provide a clear separation between high-level robot software and low-level hardware control while allowing easy maintenance and future extensions.

The Raspberry Pi executes the complete ROS2 software stack including localization, navigation and safety supervision. Sensor information from the laser scanners and the IMU is processed on the Raspberry Pi, while motion commands are transmitted to the Arduino motor controller. The Arduino is responsible for the real-time control of the integrated servo motors.

## 4.2 GPIO Connections

The Raspberry Pi GPIO interface is used to communicate with the external safety hardware. Digital outputs control the active monitoring cases of the SICK NanoScan3 safety scanners, while dedicated GPIO lines are used to reset the safety relays and monitor their status.

The following diagram illustrates the GPIO assignment and the electrical connections between the Raspberry Pi, the relay board, the safety relays and the laser scanners.

Software Architecture
=====================

The MensaBot software is based on a modular ROS 2 architecture. Individual functionalities are implemented as independent ROS 2 packages that communicate through standardized ROS interfaces such as topics, services, actions, and the TF framework.

This architecture enables both simulation and operation on the physical robot while sharing nearly the same software stack. Only the hardware-specific interfaces differ between both operating modes.

   Overview of the MensaBot software architecture.

Software Layers
---------------

The software is organized into several functional layers:

* Sensor Layer
* Localization Layer
* Navigation Layer
* Safety Layer
* Motion Control Layer
* Hardware Layer

Each layer is responsible for a dedicated task and communicates with neighboring layers through well-defined ROS 2 interfaces.

Package Organization
--------------------

The ROS 2 workspace consists of multiple packages, each implementing a specific subsystem.

====================== ==============================================
Package                Responsibility
====================== ==============================================
mensabot_bringup       Launch files for simulation and real hardware
mensabot_description   Robot model and URDF description
mensabot_navigation    Navigation and localization configuration
mensabot_hardware      ros2_control hardware interface
mensabot_simulation    Gazebo simulation environment
mensabot_utils         Utility and safety nodes
====================== ==============================================

Additional third-party ROS packages are integrated for sensor drivers, localization, and navigation.

Software Pipeline
-----------------

During normal operation, the software executes the following processing sequence:

1. Sensors acquire environmental and motion data.
2. Localization estimates the current robot pose.
3. The navigation stack calculates the desired robot motion.
4. The safety system validates all motion commands.
5. Velocity commands are converted for the drive controller.
6. The hardware interface transmits commands to the motor controller.
7. The robot executes the requested movement.
